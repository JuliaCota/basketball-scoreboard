<h1>Basketball Scoreboard</h1>

<h3>Summary: </h3>

This project is part of the "Practice Time - part 1" section of the "Learn Javascript" course from Scrimba, where the student is required to finish the project on their own without extensive help.
In my case, without any help for I do not have the Scrimba subscription, therefore no help was given, I only saw a png of the project and a file saying what it had to do.

This application is a program that allows you to count a basketball game score (1, 2 and 3 points), and then reset the counter when a new game start.
